# Overview

I've developed a simple C++ program to demonstrate basic game mechanics using the command-line interface. This program implements a word guessing game where the player has to guess letters to uncover a hidden word. The game provides feedback on correct and incorrect guesses and allows the player a limited number of attempts to guess the word.

My purpose in creating this software is to enhance my understanding of C++ language syntax, particularly in handling file input/output, string manipulation, loops, conditionals, and basic data structures like vectors.

# Development Environment

I developed this software using the following tools:

- **IDE:** Visual Studio Code
- **Compiler:** g++ (GNU Compiler Collection)

The software is written in C++, utilizing standard libraries such as `<iostream>`, `<fstream>`, `<string>`, `<vector>`, `<algorithm>`, `<random>`, `<chrono>`, `<limits>`, and `<cctype>`.

# Useful Websites

During the development of this project, I found the following websites helpful:

- [cplusplus.com](http://www.cplusplus.com/): Useful for C++ documentation and reference.
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/): Helpful for troubleshooting and finding solutions to specific programming problems.

# Future Work

In the future, I plan to improve and expand this project by:

- Adding a scoring system to track player performance.
- Implementing a more sophisticated word selection mechanism, such as filtering words by length or difficulty.
- Enhancing the user interface for a more interactive experience.
- Adding support for multiplayer functionality, allowing multiple players to guess words in turns.
- Implementing error handling to gracefully handle unexpected input and edge cases.
